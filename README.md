# Task Management App

## Overview

This project is a task management application that allows users to view, interact with tasks, and upload attachments. It includes a ReactJS-based frontend and a Node.js-based backend API to store and manage task data, including file uploads.

## Features Implemented

### Part 1: Task Cards and Scrollable Layout

- Single Page Layout: The page is designed as a single page with a horizontal scrollbar to display task cards.
- Scrollable Task Cards: The task cards are horizontally scrollable within their parent containers, providing an efficient way to view multiple tasks at once.

### Part 2: File Attachments

- File Picker and Modal: Users can pick an attachment, and the selected file is displayed in a modal.
- Multiple File Upload: Users can upload multiple files. The list of uploaded files displays:
- Original file name
- File extension

### Part 3: Backend API for File Storage

- File Upload API: A backend API to handle file uploads and save the data in the database.
- File Count: The application counts the number of attachments uploaded for each task and displays this information.
